Solving Database Duplication
One solution to solving database duplication would be using a primary key. I took MIC 101 last quarter and learned
about and how to use Microsoft Office. When you create a database using tables with Access you can use a primary key.
A primary key is an attribute that is unique or that can be generated by the server. If you have a database of 
information that you know will have duplicates the first example that comes to mind is names. It is very likely 
there will be duplicate first, middle, last or entire  names. Instead of using names and making that the primary
key it would be better to have an ID number. The ID number would be the primary key because it will generate a unique
set of numbers for a person. You will be able to find a particular person based on that number rather than their name.
The chance of having duplicate names would be difficult to avoid but having the ID number be the primary key each
person would have a unique identifier.
